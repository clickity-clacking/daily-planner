# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

Challenge 5 for UCLA coding bootcamp. This site displays the working hours and allows the user to schedule apointments per hour, save those apointments, and have them reappear when they revisit the page as they were saved in local storage. Also, the hours are color coded by whether the hour has passed, is present, or in the future.
